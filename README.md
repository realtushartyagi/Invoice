## How to Run the Project

### Option 1: Using the Web Interface (Backend + Frontend)

#### Start the Backend Server:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start the Flask backend server:
   ```bash
   python backend.py
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

#### Start the Frontend:
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser, or
2. Use a local web server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Option 2: Using the Desktop GUI Application

Run the PyQt5 desktop application:
```bash
python PDF-to-Excel.py
```

## Code Structure

### PdfConverter Class
This class contains static methods for handling PDF conversion:

- `convert_pdf_table_to_excel(pdf_path, output_file)`: Extracts tables from a PDF and saves them into an Excel file.
- `extract_tables_from_pdf(pdf_path)`: Extracts multiple tables from a PDF.
- `export_tables_to_excel(tables, output_excel_path)`: Exports extracted tables to an Excel file.
- `convert_pdf_text_to_excel(pdf_path, output_file)`: Extracts all text from a PDF and saves it into an Excel file.
- `process_ocr(pdf_path, output_file)`: Uses OCR to extract text from scanned PDFs.
- `export_to_excel(detections, output_file)`: Exports OCR-detected text to an Excel file.

### Ui_MainWindow Class
This class defines the GUI for the application:

- `setupUi(MainWindow)`: Sets up the main window, buttons, and options.
- `retranslateUi(MainWindow)`: Sets the text for UI elements.
- `openFileDialog()`: Opens a file dialog to select a PDF file.
- `onOkButtonClicked()`: Handles the conversion process based on the selected option.

## Example
1. Launch the application.
2. Select a PDF file using the "File" button.
3. Choose an option (e.g., "PDF Table to Excel").
4. Click "Ok" and select the output location.
5. The application will generate an Excel file with the extracted data.

## Notes
- Ensure that the selected PDF file is not corrupted or password-protected.
- For OCR functionality, the PDF should contain scanned images of text.
